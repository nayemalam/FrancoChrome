## A chrome extension that allows anglophones to passively build their French vocabulary over time
https://devpost.com/software/conuhacks-hp7u2m#updates

Moving to a new region or country can be tough for anyone, however, moving to a region where you don't speak the language can be even more challenging.

FrancoChrome is designed to make this transition easier for anglophones in French majority regions. Everyday, as users open a new tab in the Chrome browser, they are presented with a new word in French along with it's English translation. In this manner, over the course of a year a user will be introduced to 10 000+ french words along with their pronunciation by a native French speaker.

This means that as time progresses, the user continually builds their vocabulary passively and is able to better communicate with individuals in their neighborhoods.

The entire project is hosted as a Chrome extension and will eventually be available on Chrome Web Store.
